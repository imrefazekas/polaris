General conventions:

All strings passed as parameters will be added to the actual parameter list.
String expression with values will be interpreted as options.

Example:
A service of Smith looks like this:
	act
	$ {cli_cmd} Smith act greetings title name opts

can be called as follows:

$ {cli_cmd} Smith act Hello Mr. Smith --suspect_name=neo

"Smith" is the name of the entity providing some services. "act" is the name of the service to be called and X parameters are passed as "greetings" "title" "name" accordingly.
All Y parameters will be collected, extended by the environment variables and passed as the last "opts" parameter.
